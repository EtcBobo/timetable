profile picture loads slow

art asset needed:

things to ask:


problem is solved:
image base64 problem - base64 strings are huge and takes too long to read, therefore slowing down functions that does not require image loading. The base64 string is then moved to another table and called upon when required to save time
openframe problem - using only openFrame or openWin is too limiting and the design looks very inconsistent. Therefore a frame and a body html page is created seperately and is loaded the same way as index.html
