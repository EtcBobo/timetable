things to ask:


problem i solved:
image base64 problem - base64 strings are huge and takes too long to read, therefore slowing down functions that does not require image loading. The base64 string is then moved to another table and called upon when required to save time
openframe problem - using only openFrame or openWin is too limiting and the design looks very inconsistent. Therefore a frame and a body html page is created seperately and is loaded the same way as index.html
smssdk - project folder could not sync with the cloud version, hence the module smssdk and mobtools could not be added. The current github folder have to match the criteria and uploaded to the cloud for the modules to run successfully
designing dynamic timetable with html + CSS -  using a html table is challenging since any custom timetable block have to take up an exact amount of columns and rows.after much consideration I decided to give each grid an id so that i can change all affected grid's CSS at once. By setting display="none" for blocks i don't need, i can prevent an overflow of grids 
back button - because frames are being opened on top of each other, the method closeFrame() has to be dynamic since the frame name is constantly changing. In order to make it dynamic, the api.frame method is called to get all current frames' name. After that I just have to close the last frame in the array to mimic a back action.
Changing the core function to a calendar -  After much consideration, I decided to add a calendar feature on top of my timetable feature. The whole design is also going to be overhauled to provide better user experience.
