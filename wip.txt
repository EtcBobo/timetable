problem i solved:
image base64 problem - base64 strings are huge and takes too long to read, therefore slowing down functions that does not require image loading. The base64 string is then moved to another table and called upon when required to save time
openframe problem - using only openFrame or openWin is too limiting and the design looks very inconsistent. Therefore a frame and a body html page is created seperately and is loaded the same way as index.html

task completed this week:
Local storage for persistent data across pages
Password validation for at least 6 characters, one alphabet and one number
Password hashing
Ip address for wifi stored in txt file for reading
